# Global Privacy Control (GPC) enabler

This is the source code of the browser extension [GPC enabler](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gpc-enabler/ilknagnpcicckgohjailfooamibaolnj).

It is the minimal code required to be fully compliant with [Global Privacy Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Privacy_Control), a set of technologies that allows websites to passively detect your cookie and tracking preferences. If this became a default (or even enforced!) practice, we could get rid of all those terrible cookie popups, and the web would be a nicer place again.
